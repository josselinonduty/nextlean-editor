# ROADMAP

This project is an alpha version of an AI-assisted Lean editor. Its sole purpose is to demonstrate that such an application is feasible. It is not production-ready.

Many alternatives can already be used for Lean development, and I would recommend using those instead.

**Visual Studio Code** with the [Lean extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leanprover.lean4) is currently the most mature and feature-rich option. Combined with GitHub Copilot Chat or Roo Code extension to provide AI assistance, it offers a powerful environment for Lean development. One could even create [MCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol) tools to enhance the AI's understanding of Lean code, by providing easy access to the Lean server or internal information.
